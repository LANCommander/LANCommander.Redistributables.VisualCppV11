.SYNOPSIS
    Resolves and downloads the upstream Visual C++ v11 Redistributable (2012) installers.
.DESCRIPTION
    Contract:
      -CheckOnly            write the upstream version to stdout and exit.
      -OutputPath <dir>     download the installers there, then emit a JSON object
                            with Version and optionally Changelog.

    Microsoft publishes no version number for the v14 package anywhere. There is
    no release feed, and the download page deliberately omits the version because
    the package is updated frequently -- their own instructions are to download the
    installer and read "File version" off its properties in Explorer. So none of
    Resolve-UpstreamVersion's resolvers apply and the version is read out of the
    downloaded installer's PE version resource instead. The older per-year packages
    are pinned and never move, so the same code simply reports the same version
    every time, which is correct.

    The installers are copied in byte-for-byte under their original filenames --
    vcredist_x86.exe and vcredist_x64.exe, not the vc_redist.<arch>.exe spelling the
    2015+ packages use. The sibling VC++ repositories normalise the name for a
    uniform payload layout; this one deliberately does not, because the Visual
    Studio 2012 REDIST list grants redistribution of these files by name. Keeping
    them removes any argument about what was distributed. Scripts/Install.ps1 and
    Scripts/Package.ps1 expect this spelling to match.

    Changelog is deliberately null. Microsoft publishes no per-build changelog at a
    stable URL, and inventing one would put fiction in every release body.

.SYNOPSIS
    Reads the four-part file version out of a Windows PE image.
.DESCRIPTION
    This is why both workflows pin runs_on to windows-latest. .NET's Unix
    implementation of FileVersionInfo does not read PE version resources -- it
    returns an empty string for a perfectly valid Windows executable rather than
    failing -- so on Linux every version would silently come back blank.

    An empty result therefore means one of two things: the wrong runner, or a
    download that was not a PE at all. A broken aka.ms redirect serving an HTML
    error page under a .exe name looks exactly like the latter, so the size is
    reported to tell them apart.
